    "## Q1.  Underfitting means that your model makes accurate, but initially incorrect predictions. In this case, train error is large and val/test error is large too. Overfitting means that your model makes not accurate predictions. In this case, train error is very small and val/test error is large\n",
    "### Underfitting occurs when your model produces accurate but inaccurate predictions at first. In this scenario, the training error is substantial, as is the validation/test error. Overfitting occurs when your model fails to generate correct predictions.\n",

    "## Q4.  in statistics and machine learning, the bias–variance tradeoff is the property of a model that the variance of the parameter estimated across samples can be reduced by increasing the bias in the estimated parameters.\n",
    "### Bias and variance are inversely connected. It is impossible to have an ML model with a low bias and a low variance. When a data engineer modifies the ML algorithm to better fit a given data set, it will lead to low bias—but it will increase variance.\n",
    "### A model that exhibits small variance and high bias will underfit the target, while a model with high variance and little bias will overfit the target. A model with high variance may represent the data set accurately but could lead to overfitting to noisy or otherwise unrepresentative training data."

Using Regularization, we can fit our machine learning model appropriately on a given test set and hence reduce the errors in it.\n",
