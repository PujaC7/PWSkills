Every unique value in the category will be added as a feature. One-Hot Encoding is the process of creating dummy variables.\n",
    "### For example, consider a dataset containing information about different types of fruit. One-hot encoding would create a separate column for each type of fruit, with a value of 1 indicating that the row contains data about that fruit and a value of 0 indicating that it does not."

In particular, one hot encoding is used for our output values, since it provides more nuanced predictions than single labels."
