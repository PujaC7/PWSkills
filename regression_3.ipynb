    "## Q1.  Ridge regression is a method of estimating the coefficients of multiple-regression models in scenarios where the independent variables are highly correlated. It has been used in many fields including econometrics, chemistry, and engineering.\n",
    "### Ridge regression is a term used to refer to a linear regression model whose coefficients are estimated not by ordinary least squares (OLS), but by an estimator, called ridge estimator, that, albeit biased, has lower variance than the OLS estimator."

    "### The assumptions of ridge regression are the same as that of linear regression: linearity, constant variance, and independence. However, as ridge regression does not provide confidence limits, the distribution of errors to be normal need not be assumed."

    "### Selecting a good value for λ is critical. When λ=0, the penalty term has no effect, and ridge regression will produce the classical least square coefficients. However, as λ increases to infinite, the impact of the shrinkage penalty grows, and the ridge regression coefficients will get close zero."

The lasso coefficients become zero in a certain range and are reduced by a constant factor, which explains their low magnitude in comparison to the ridge."
