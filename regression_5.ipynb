    "## Q1.  Elastic net linear regression uses the penalties from both the lasso and ridge techniques to regularize regression models. The technique combines both the lasso and ridge regression methods by learning from their shortcomings to improve the regularization of statistical models\n",
    "###  Elastic net regression is a linear regression technique that uses a penalty term to shrink the coefficients of the predictors. The penalty term is a combination of the l1-norm (absolute value) and the l2-norm (square) of the coefficients, weighted by a parameter called alpha."

    "For instance, it can handle multicollinearity better than lasso regression by grouping correlated features and selecting the most representative ones. Additionally, it can reduce model complexity by eliminating irrelevant features, which is more effective than ridge regression\n",
    "### disadvantage\n",
    "One of the pitfalls and challenges of elastic net is that it requires tuning two hyperparameters: alpha and lambda. Hyperparameters are parameters that are not learned by the model, but need to be specified by the user."
