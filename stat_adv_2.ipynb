    "## Q1.  The Probability Mass Function (PMF) is also called a probability function or frequency function which characterizes the distribution of a discrete random variable. Let X be a discrete random variable of a function, then the probability mass function of a random variable X is given by Px (x) = P( X=x ), For all x belongs to the range of X.\n",
    "### example: rolling a dice\n",
    "## The Probability Density Function(PDF) defines the probability function representing the density of a continuous random variable lying between a specific range of values. In other words, the probability density function produces the likelihood of values of the continuous random variable. Sometimes it is also called a probability distribution function or just a probability function. However, this function is stated in many other sources as the function over a broad set of values. Often it is referred to as cumulative distribution function or sometimes as probability mass function(PMF). However, the actual truth is PDF (probability density function ) is defined for continuous random variables, whereas PMF (probability mass function) is defined for discrete random variables.\n",
