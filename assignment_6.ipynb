    "## Q1.  a. Designing a Data Ingestion Pipeline:\n",
    "To design a data ingestion pipeline that collects and stores data from various sources, such as databases, APIs, and streaming platforms, you can follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Identify data sources: Determine the different types of data sources you want to collect data from. This can include databases (relational or NoSQL), APIs (RESTful or GraphQL), file systems, message queues, or streaming platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Define data ingestion methods: Based on the data sources identified, choose appropriate methods to extract data. For databases, you can use query-based extraction methods, such as SQL queries or change data capture (CDC) techniques. For APIs, use the respective client libraries or frameworks to fetch data. For file systems, you can use file monitoring techniques to detect changes or scheduled jobs to process files. Streaming platforms may require using stream processing frameworks like Apache Kafka or Apache Flink.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Establish connectivity: Set up the necessary connections and credentials to access the data sources. This can involve configuring network access, authentication tokens, API keys, or database connection strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Extract data: Develop or configure components to extract data from the identified sources. This might involve writing code to execute queries, invoking APIs, subscribing to streams, or reading files. Extracted data can be fetched in batches or in real-time, depending on the requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Transform and cleanse data: Once the data is extracted, apply any necessary transformations and cleansing operations. This can include data type conversions, data enrichment, filtering, deduplication, or any other business logic required to prepare the data for storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Validate and clean data: Perform data validation checks to ensure the integrity and quality of the collected data. Validate data against predefined rules, check for missing values or anomalies, and handle any data inconsistencies. Cleansing operations can involve removing or correcting invalid or incomplete records.\n",
    "\n",
