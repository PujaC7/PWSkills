Euclidean distance is the shortest path between source and destination which is a straight line as shown in Figure 1.3. but Manhattan distance is sum of all the real distances between source(s) and destination(d) and each distance are always the straight lines as shown in Figure 1.4.\n",

Overall, it is recommended to have an odd number for k to avoid ties in classification, and cross-validation tactics can help you choose the optimal k for your dataset."

    "### The choice of distance measures is very important, as it has a strong influence on the clustering results. For most common clustering software, the default distance measure is the Euclidean distance. Depending on the type of the data and the researcher questions, other dissimilarity measures might be preferred."
