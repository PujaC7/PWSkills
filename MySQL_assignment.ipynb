    "#### In SQL, the CREATE DATABASE statement is used to create a database though the ANSI standard does not contain a CREATE DATABASE statement. The database names are case sensitive in Unix but this restriction does not apply in Windows. This is also true for table names. The best practice is to use same letter case while creating a database as well as tables.\n",

    "#### It is a Data Definition Language Command (DDL). It is used to drop the whole table. With the help of the “DROP” command we can drop (delete) the whole structure in one go i.e. it removes the named elements of the schema. By using this command the existence of the whole table is finished or say lost.\n",
    "### ALTER\n",
    "#### The ALTER DATABASE statement is used to modify, maintain, or recover an existing database.\n",
    "### TRUNCATE \n",
    "#### It is also a Data Definition Language Command (DDL). It is used to delete all the rows of a relation (table) in one go. With the help of the “TRUNCATE” command, we can’t delete the single row as here WHERE clause is not used. By using this command the existence of all the rows of the table is lost. It is comparatively faster than the delete command as it deletes all the rows fastly. "
